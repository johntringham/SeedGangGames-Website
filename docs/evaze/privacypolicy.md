Evaze uses Admob, a third party service by Google that provides the adverts in Evaze. 

Admob collects information in order to provide and improve its services, as well as providing analytics to the developer (Seed Gang Games).

Some information Google/Admob may collect from users:

- IP address, which may be used to estimate the general location of a device.
- Non-user related crash logs, which may be used to diagnose problems and improve the SDK. Diagnostic information may also be used for advertising and analytics purposes.
- User-associated performance data such as app launch time, hang rate, or energy usage, which may be used to evaluate user behavior, understand the effectiveness of existing product features, and plan new features. Performance data may also be used for displaying ads, including sharing with other entities that display ads.
- A Device ID such as the device's advertising identifier or other app-bounded device identifiers, which may be used for the purpose of third-party advertising and analytics.
- Advertising data, such as advertisements the user has seen, may be used to power analytics and advertising features.
- Other user product interactions like app launch taps, and interaction information, like video views, may be used to improve advertising performance.

If personalised adverts are turned on, then alongside the above, Google/Admob may use the following to personalise adverts and to provide analytics:

- Age group - Identifies users by six categories: 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65+
- App Store - The store from which the app was downloaded and installed
- App Version - The version name (Android) or the Bundle version (iOS)
- Country - The country the user resides in
- Device Brand - The brand name of the mobile device (e.g., Motorola, LG, or Samsung)
- Device Category - The category of the mobile device (e.g., mobile or tablet)
- Device Model - The mobile device model name (e.g., iPhone 5s or SM-J500M)
- First Open Time - The time (in milliseconds, UTC) at which the user first opened the app, rounded up to the next hour
- Gender
- Interests - Lists the interests of the user (e.g., "Arts & Entertainment, Games, Sports")
- Language - The language setting of the device OS (e.g., en-us or pt-br)
- Whether the user is 'New' or 'Established' (New: First opened the app within the last 7 days. Established: First opened the app more than 7 days ago)
- OS Version - The version of the device OS (e.g., 9.3.2 or 5.1.1)

Admob uses the collected information to:

- Deliver their services, including serving adverts that appear in the app.
- Maintain and improve these services
- Develop new services
- Measure the effectiveness of advertising
- Protect against fraud and abuse
- Personalize content and ads you see on Google and on their partners' sites and apps
- Provide aggregated analytics to app developers (such as Seed Gang Games in this case) about the users of the app. This analytics service is provided via the Google product Firebase (<https://firebase.google.com/>).

In the Evaze app, you have an option to request non-personalised adverts. This changes the way that Evaze interacts with the Google Admob library. The following is a quote from Google Admob that summarises the difference:

> _Taken from <https://support.google.com/admob/answer/7676680?hl=en> on 18th November 2021_

> #### Personalized ads
> Personalized advertising (formerly known as interest-based advertising) is a powerful tool that improves advertising relevance for users and increases ROI for advertisers. In all our publisher products, we make inferences about a user’s interests based on the sites they visit or the apps they use. This allows advertisers to target their campaigns according to these interests, providing an improved experience for users and advertisers alike. [Learn more about our advertiser policies for personalized ads](https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/143465).
> 
> Google considers ads to be personalized when they are based on previously collected or historical data to determine or influence ad selection, including a user's previous search queries, activity, visits to sites or apps, demographic information, or location. Specifically, this would include, for example: demographic targeting, interest category targeting, remarketing, targeting Customer Match lists, and targeting audience lists uploaded in DoubleClick Bid Manager or Campaign Manager 360.
>
> #### Non-personalized ads (NPA)
> Non-personalized ads are ads that are not based on a user’s past behavior. They are targeted using contextual information, including coarse (such as city-level) geo-targeting based on current location, and content on the current site or app or current query terms. Google disallows all [personalized targeting](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9713), including demographic targeting and user list targeting. 
>
> Although non-personalized ads don’t use cookies or mobile ad identifiers for ad targeting, they do still use cookies or mobile ad identifiers for frequency capping, aggregated ad reporting, and to combat fraud and abuse.

As the last sentence of the above quote indicates, if a user requests non-personalised advertising, a number of functional cookies will still be used to provide a stable service and for reporting, but these cookies will not be used for ad targeting.
